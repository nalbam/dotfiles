# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in any project.

# Language / 언어

**Always respond in Korean (한국어로 응답하세요).**
- 모든 응답은 한국어로 작성
- 코드, 명령어, 기술 용어는 영어 유지
- 커밋 메시지, 코드 주석은 영어 유지

# Git Safety / Git 안전 규칙

**NEVER commit or push without explicit user permission.**
- 사용자가 명시적으로 요청할 때만 `git commit`, `git push` 실행
- 코드 변경 후 자동으로 커밋하지 않음

# Global Code Guidelines

**Important: Refer to project-specific documentation (e.g., docs/, README.md) when available.**

**Important: Before writing new code, search for similar existing code and maintain consistent patterns.**

**Important: Perform only the necessary work. If work is not needed, stop.**

## Mindset

- Think like a senior engineer.
- Don't rush to conclusions; evaluate multiple approaches before deciding.
- Problem definition → small, safe change → review → refactor — repeat the loop.
- Keep changes small, focused, and incremental.

## Before Changing Code

- Read relevant files end to end, including call/reference paths.
- Locate definitions, references, call sites, related tests, and configs.
- Do not change code without having read the entire file.
- Record assumptions clearly.

## Core Principles

- **Solve the right problem**: Avoid unnecessary complexity or scope creep.
- **Favor standard solutions**: Use well-known libraries and patterns before writing custom code.
- **Keep code readable**: Use clear naming, logical structure, and avoid deep nesting.
- **Handle errors explicitly**: Catch specific exceptions, fail fast with meaningful messages.
- **Design for security**: Validate inputs, apply least privilege, never expose secrets.
- **Keep dependencies shallow**: Minimize tight coupling, maintain clear boundaries.
- **Address root causes**: Fix the underlying issue, not symptoms.

## Problem Solving & Root Cause Analysis

When troubleshooting issues, follow this systematic process:

### Investigation Steps
1. **Reproduce**: Document exact error messages, stack traces, and environment details
2. **Investigate**:
   - Read error messages carefully - they often contain the root cause
   - Check logs for patterns, warnings, or errors leading up to failure
   - Trace execution path from entry point to failure point
   - Verify assumptions with minimal experiments
3. **Root Cause**:
   - Ask "Why?" 5 times until reaching the fundamental issue
   - Distinguish symptoms from causes (e.g., "API returns 500" vs "connection pool exhausted")
   - Look for systemic issues, not one-off failures
4. **Fix**: Address root cause, not symptoms; document workarounds if necessary
5. **Verify**: Test thoroughly, add regression tests, check for similar issues elsewhere

### Example
**Symptom**: Intermittent crashes in production
**Bad**: Add error handling + auto-restart
**Good**: Profile → identify memory leak (temp files not cleaned) → fix cleanup + add limits → verify with load test

## File Size Guidelines

- Keep source code files under 800 lines (absolute maximum).
- Typical files should be 200-400 lines.
- Consider refactoring when files approach 500+ lines.
- Split large components into smaller, focused modules.

## Function Size Guidelines

- Keep functions under 50 lines.
- Extract helper functions when logic becomes complex.
- Single Responsibility Principle: one function, one purpose.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: Test logic in isolation, fast (<10ms), deterministic
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions with realistic scenarios
- **Coverage**: Aim for 80%+ on core logic, 100% on critical paths
- **Bug fixes**: Must include regression tests
- **Dependencies**: Use mocks/stubs for external services
- **Independence**: Tests should not share state or depend on execution order
- Keep tests readable - they serve as documentation

## Documentation

- Write self-documenting code: clear names, logical structure
- Add comments only for non-obvious logic (explain "why", not "what")
- Keep README.md updated with setup instructions, usage examples, and architecture overview
- Document APIs with request/response examples and error cases
- Update documentation when changing behavior or adding features
- Avoid outdated comments - delete rather than leave incorrect information

## Version Control

- **Commits**:
  - Small, atomic changes with single purpose
  - Use imperative mood: "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug"
  - Format: "verb + what + why if not obvious"
  - Good: "Add retry logic to handle network timeouts"
  - Bad: "Update code", "Fix stuff", "WIP"
- **Branches**: Short-lived feature branches from main
- **Pull Requests**:
  - One feature per PR, self-review before submission
  - Include description, testing steps, and screenshots if UI change
- **Best Practices**:
  - Never commit secrets, binaries, or generated files
  - Avoid force push to shared branches
  - Rebase local branches, merge to main

## Code Review & Collaboration

- **Before Submitting**:
  - Review your own diff first
  - Ensure tests pass and code is linted
  - Check for debug code, console.logs, TODOs
- **As Reviewer**:
  - Focus on logic, edge cases, and maintainability
  - Ask questions, don't just criticize
  - Approve only if you understand and verify the changes
- **Receiving Feedback**:
  - Respond promptly and professionally
  - Explain your reasoning, but be open to better approaches
  - Mark conversations resolved only after addressing them

## Security Rules

- Never expose secrets in code, logs, or commits.
- Validate, sanitize, and encode all inputs.
- Apply the Principle of Least Privilege.
- Do not log sensitive data.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Code Quality
- Modifying code without reading the full context
- Ignoring failures, warnings, or edge cases
- Premature optimization or abstraction
- Using broad exception handlers

### Problem Solving
- Quick fixes without understanding the root cause
- Treating symptoms (try-catch everywhere) instead of fixing causes
- Stopping at the first plausible explanation
- Skipping verification after implementing a fix
